# What is sl-ember-test-helpers

This addon provides and registers test helpers for use in the testing of your application.  This addon is compatible with QUnit, Mocha, and any other testing framework you wish to use (or at least should be).


---

# Provided helpers

## Synchronous

### ajax

Emulates the beginning and completion of an AJAX request or requests.

* `ajax.begin()` triggers the `ajaxStart` event on the document
* `ajax.begin( 'endpointValue' )` triggers the `ajaxSend` event on the document, passing the supplied endpoint value
* `ajax.end()` triggers the `ajaxStop` event on the document
* `ajax.end( 'endpointValue' )` triggers the `ajaxComplete` event on the document, passing the supplied endpoint value


### contains

```
contains( valuesUnderTest, valuesToTestFor );
```

Determine whether values are contained in other values.  These values can be a combination of Arrays, Strings, or Objects (for which the keys are extracted).  All *valuesToTestFor* must exist in *valuesUnderTest* for this determination to pass successfully.

Calls to `contains()` return a boolean which can then be used in your tests.

This call would fail because the Object being tested does not contain keys matching the values of "a" and "b":

```
contains( { c: 1, b: 3 }, [ 'a', 'b' ] );
```

This call would pass because the Array being tested contains the value of "b":

```
contains( [ 'a', 'b' ], 'b' );
```

### requires

Use this helper to test that an argument passed to a function is of the required type(s).  The first argument is the function under test and the second argument is an array of types to test for.

```
requires( functionUnderTest, [ 'string', 'object', 'function' ] );
```

#### Types

* number
* string
* array
* object
* function
* undefined
* boolean

The call to `requires` returns an object:

```
{
    requires: <boolean: true if functionUnderTest requires the provided arguments, false if not>
    messages: <string: message per argument type that failed>
}
```


## Asynchronous

### ajax

See description in *Synchronous* section

### contains

### requires

# Utilities

There are several utility functions provided in the */test-support/helpers/sl/utils/utils.js* file that, while used internally by the helpers themselves, can be imported as needed for use.  These include:

* convertToArray()
* convertStringToArray()
* convertObjectKeysToArray()
* doArraysIntersect()


---

# How to use this addon in your application

## Install this addon as a Node module

```
ember install:addon sl-ember-test-helpers
```

## If running Synchronous tests, such as Unit Tests

For each test helper you wish to use, you will need to import them into each individual Unit Tests. For example:

```
import { contains } from '../../helpers/sl/synchronous';
```

## If running Asynchronous tests, such as Acceptance Tests

Installing this addon via the `ember install:addon` command will automatically run the generator, which will make changes to the following files:

* tests/helpers/start-app.js
* tests/.jshintrc

If your application is under source control management, such as via Git, make sure to commit these changes.

The generator makes changes to the above files assuming the structure of them has not changed much from the default version created during the initial Ember application creation.  If too many changes have been made you will need to manually make the changes below:

* Add `import slregisterTestHelpers from './sl/register-test-helpers';` to the beginning of the *tests/helpers/start-app.js* file
* In the *tests/helpers/start-app.js* file, place `slregisterTestHelpers();` before the `application.injectTestHelpers()` line
* Add `"contains",` to the `predef` section of the */tests/.jshintrc* file
